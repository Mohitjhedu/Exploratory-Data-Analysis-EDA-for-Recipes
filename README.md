# 🍽️ Recipe Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my project on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for a recipe dataset! In this project, I explored a large dataset to gain insights that can help a recipe-based business grow and improve.

## 📄 Project Overview
This project is all about exploring and analyzing a recipe dataset. I focused on cleaning the data, finding trends, and understanding the key factors that affect recipe popularity. The goal is to help businesses make informed decisions using the insights from the data.

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

### Data Cleaning:
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
- Handled missing values where needed.
